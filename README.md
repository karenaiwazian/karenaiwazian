<h1>Hi, I'm Karen Aiwazian</h1>
I am creating a messenger with a completely new approach to privacy and anonymity. Here, each user chooses their own level of secrecy. No phone number or email is required for registration.

To prove the transparency and integrity of the system, I am opening the source code of both the <a href="https://github.com/karenaiwazian/messenger_client">client</a> and server parts of the application.

You can also download the latest version of the Android app <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenaiwazian/karenaiwazian/main/messenger.apk" download>here</a>.
