# Hi, I'm Karen Aiwazian

I am creating a messenger with a completely new approach to privacy and anonymity. Here, each user chooses their own level of secrecy. No phone number or email is required for registration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prove the transparency and integrity of the system, I am opening the source code of both the <a href="https://github.com/karenaiwazian/messenger_client">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/karenaiwazian/Messenger_Server">server</a> parts of the application.

> [!WARNING]
> The application is under development.
